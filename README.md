# Movie Marathoner

## Overview
This application is tool to allow the user to keep track of movies they are interested in watching/are currently watching/have already seen. The application will provide the user with movies (generated through a search,) which can then be placed within one of three columns (Movies to watch, Currently watching and Finished watching.)
This saves the users searched movies, whilst allowing them to keep track of what they are watching. At the bottom of the page there will be a different random movie quote each time the page is loaded, just to add an extra bit of fun to the application!

This application was created using:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* ReactJS
* Node
* Server-side API
* Material UI v5.11.13
* Netlify 

This application runs with the use of a server-side API to retrieve Movie data. This Api is:
* OMDB API

It also utilizes the following libraries/packages:
* Material UI
* React DnD
* Popular-movie-quotes npm package
* Bootstrap

## Description and Usage
The application features a simple search bar at the top, allowing the user to easily search for movie titles. Once a title is entered, it is stored in the user's search history and displayed in the 'Movies to watch' column.

With the drag and drop functionality, the user can effortlessly move their search results between three columns to create organized movie watch-lists, making it easier to keep track of the movies they want to see.

In addition to the practical features, the application adds a fun and entertaining touch by displaying a random movie quote in the footer each time the page is refreshed.

We worked together to produce this application by splitting the work between ourselves and using the git workflow to merge our work into a single deployed application. To keep a clear idea of our work, we created a wireframe for our application and a Kanban Board to track our work on GitHub, as well as mapping out our react components. We held daily standup meetings and utilized agile methodologies to keep us on track.
